summary: "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!   - Hunter S. Thompson"

Life throws a lot at us - happiness, sadness, good, and bad.  Sometimes all at once. It doesn't matter, in the grand scheme of things, because we will all experience this again and again just as we have over and over again to this point in our life. The real trick is to recognize the humanity, to value the life it brings, to know that without both sides, we can't have the coin that makes things interesting. God tells us to praise him in all things - good as well as bad. He uses all things for our good, if we let him; and it is through this lens that we should look at the events around us and be happy...well, be content anyway, that it is as it should be. For most people, that is particularly difficult during the hard times. For others, like myself, I find it particularly difficult to remember to see the blessing during the good times - I am just too busy enjoying myself. Either way, I believe this is what God meant for us to understand when he told us to praise him in all things.

This section of the blog site is intended for me to write about whatever life throws at us, something to unload my thoughts into and to be able to review and contemplate objectively (well, as much as I can anyway). It also is intended to be a journal of my life activities. As much a public diary as anything else. It is another way for you to get to know me better, and to learn what I am willing to share with the world about myself. A section to ask questions and (probably) to stretch my comfort zone. It is just an exploration of what I get to experience in life and for you, the reader to not only see a little bit into my life, but through the Disqus comments interject a bit of your life experiences for other readers (and of course for me) to see as well.  Hopefully this is an interesting and useful addition to the blog. If nothing else, it is an attempt to break out into something greater than the usual topical blog.
