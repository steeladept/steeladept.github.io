This section is where I will discuss what I know or learn about scripting. In particular, I will have a lot regarding Powershell and Powershell Core, as that is what I am already well versed in, and moreover, what I am looking forward to in Linux. I also intend to learn Python as that is a Linux staple that works well in Windows too, and may eventually be a replacement for Powershell in my day-to-day scripting arsenal, though I doubt it. Either way, knowing both gives me a stong administrative presence in any datacenter, and this section is where I will keep my most useful, or most forgetful tips, scripts, and/or blips to learn from.
