GitHub pages is an interesting and useful utility to allow anyone to start building up a static website free of charge. This service is designed to allow GitHub repository owners to host the website to talk about the code that is stored in the repository. However, you can equally use it to host the website itself. There are some restrictions to it, of course, but largely they are easy to deal with for the casual user or individual just wanting a place to put their writing.If you need more, checkout [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) or a host of other options to place your musings.For me, and many like me, this is enough, appropriate, and best of all easy (once it is setup!).
