summary: "One thing about IT tools is it isn't only about your personal tools.IT is first, and foremost, about enabling others to do their jobs safely, efficiently, and effectively.To do that, requires a host of Enterprise Tools to ensure security, data integrity, and a functional environment for the business applications to function in.This is another tooling post that reviews some of the Enterprise solutions I have used/implemented and why I liked them."

## Development Software ##

This is not the individual IDE but the team software used to aggregate code, build code, store code and builds, etc.Basically it is everything outside the individual's development computer that is needed to turn code into useful software. It includes repositories, CI/CD solutions, and even build tooling, if appropriate. The tooling here is quite appropriately the realm of DevOps, and often associated quite specifically with the DevOps approach to release management.
