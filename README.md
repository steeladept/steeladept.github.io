# Welcome to Steeladept's Github Pages #

For the longest time I used OneNote for tracking my notes.  Then I ran into a job where it was Linux only and we couldn't use OneNote.  OneNote alternatives, such as Evernote never worked for me, so I kept on the lookout for a good note taking solution.  Wiki's seemed the way to go, but were always needlessly complicated to write a note.  Other software solutions always had drawbacks of one sort or another.  Even using Markdown had it's organizational drawbacks (to be fair, I never tried it when I was looking).  Recently, I started attending the [Pittsburgh LittleHacks](https://capozza.io/little-hack/) where I learned of using Markdown with GitHub Pages which seems to be the right combination for ease of use, cross platform, broad avialability, and portability.  As such, this is but the start to my ramblings....

## Links ##

I have a lot to say on a lot of different topics, so choose a topic below to link to the page where it is located.  If you don't know where to start, start with Errata, as there is more oddball stuff there that may amuse you if nothing else (Note that I have not enabled any of these links yet, but I will as I build them out):

[Git]() - I know very little, but as I learn it, I will post it here :)  
[Linux]() - And maybe more than a little Windows as well.  Compare and contrast what I learned to hate (or love) in each OS.  Sorry Mac, you get no love unless/until I get a Mac to learn to hate.  
[Markdown](.\Markdown\MarkdownIndex.md) - Markdown is an essential skill to master for these pages, and easy enough to learn to do.  This is my Markdown Cheatsheet (and maybe a few additional posts that are related)  
[Powershell]() - One of my core professional competencies.  'Nuf said.  
[The Learning List]() - This is just a simple list of things I have come across that I would like to learn or understand better  
[Zabbix Information]() - A variety of posts and musings of what I have learned about the Zabbix open source network monitoring solution.  
[Errata]() - a combination of odd and end postings that didn't fit anywhere else.  

### Jekyll Themes ###

For the time being, I am using Jekyll, as provided by GitHub.  As I learn more, I will likely move to Hugo because [@arielsanchezmor](arielsanchezmora.com) says so :) .  Seriously though, it really depends on what I am looking for and so far, Jekyll seems to provide enough.  

### Support or Contact ###
