Hugo, in particular, was one I looked at because others I knew, in particular [@arielsanchezmor](https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor) used Hugo successfully to create his site and keep things rolling. After learning how he worked with Hugo, I started looking at themes for ANY static site generator that fit my needs the way I want it to work.  I happened on the Jekyll Document theme and ended up coming back to Jekyll.  This blog post is a list of issues I overcame and/or realized after returning to Jekyll and learning the real ins and outs of how I use it."
